        <p>
        I am a <strong class="text-highlight"> freelance Software Engineer</strong> with a 
        passion for <strong class="text-highlight">web development.</strong>
        Whether it be a small side project, an E-Commerce store for a friend,
        or even updates to existing sites, I am interested.

        This site is used as a home base for myself and as a place for
        people to come and see what I am up to. It is also where I keep all
        of my blog posts.

              With skills in <span class="text-highlight">HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript</span> and many more web technologies, I can improve
              existing websites. I also deliver new solutions if required.
              If it's on the web, I can help. I am
              able to work with any product such as Shopify, Webflow, Wix,
              Wordpress, Squarespace and many many more. However, I love
              developing customer solutions, just like the website you are on
              now.

              I've built customer web crawlers for some clients. I enjoy the
              discovery of how different websites are built and optimising the
              best way to crawl a site and extract the data. The data has been
              used in tools such as <span class="text-highlight">ChatGPT</span>
              to aid in querying the information.

              You've got a website, it's working great but you know it could
              be doing better. I have had friends come to me to audit their
              websites. With my experience in web development I can offer
              audits of your current website to ensure best practices have
              been followed in your current solution.
